# Housingprices

As I was searching through Kaggle and other sites to find data to a new project I stumbled upon the fact that I didn't really found data about housing/rental prices in Hungary. So I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to make my next project on the topic.

To begin with, mostly I like to collect data myself that I can work on, rather than downloading cleaned data, as it gives me more experience.

So I started to look for web pages that I can scrape for the data. I uploaded the code for the web scraping and saving the data into a csv file.

After I saved all the data I needed, it was time to begin exploring and cleaning it.
