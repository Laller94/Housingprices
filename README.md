Project Overview: Analyzing Rental Prices in Budapest

Data Collection:

For my latest project, I identified a significant gap in available data related to housing and rental prices in Hungary. Instead of relying on pre-existing datasets, I decided to gather the data myself, which provided valuable hands-on experience.

To initiate this process, I began by identifying web sources that could be scraped for the necessary data. I have successfully completed the web scraping and data collection phase, resulting in a dataset that would serve as the foundation for my analysis.

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Upon obtaining the raw data, I proceeded with a thorough exploration and cleaning process. My initial examination was carried out using Excel, where I identified several data quality issues. These included missing values and inaccuracies in data representation.

To address these issues, I implemented data cleaning procedures. I systematically removed rows containing null values, ensuring that the dataset was devoid of incomplete or unreliable entries. Additionally, I rectified inaccuracies by swapping incorrectly displayed values.

Data Enrichment:

As part of the data preparation phase, I augmented the dataset by introducing new features. One notable addition was the calculation of price per square meter, a crucial metric for housing and rental analysis. This enriched dataset formed the basis for subsequent analyses.

Data Analysis and Visualization

With a clean and comprehensive dataset in hand, I proceeded to conduct exploratory data analysis. This phase involved the creation of pivot tables and charts to visualize and uncover insights from the data. These visualizations will serve as valuable tools for the subsequent phases of the project.
